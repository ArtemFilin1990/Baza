In today's demanding industrial environment, specialist technology is, more than ever, key to improved efficiency,
productivity and ultimately profitability. Timken Revolvo, is increasingly seen as a Product Brand, which routinely challenges
technological boundaries.
Rapid response and flexibility are provided from a production facility manufacturing not only split cylindrical roller bearing
assemblies but also cutting edge products for aerospace and motor sport. The unique relationship between manufacturer
and distributors combined with innovative cellular manufacturing and modular stocking offer unparalleled availability.
From concept to design, design to production, and then throughout the life cycle of the unit no other split bearing
manufacturer works so hard to exceed your expectations.
Performance
Timken® Revolvo products have been designed and
developed to maximize service life and minimize
maintenance effort.
Timken Revolvo bearings have machined brass cages
with unique single piece clips as standard, rolling
elements are profiled to minimize damaging edge
stresses and provide optimum rolling contact.
All supports and housings incorporate pry slots and
doweled machined joints for easy separation. Supports
are manufactured from high strength cast iron and
feature double webs and thick sections; product life is
thus enhanced due to high rigidity and inherent
strength.
Innovation in application
The benefits of totally split to the shaft bearing assemblies
are long established, subsequent savings in production
and maintenance are well documented.
However, split cylindrical roller bearings are today being
selected for an ever-wider range of applications. Additional
features and benefits available from the split cylindrical roller
bearing range allow our products to run faster, take higher
loads at higher temperatures and in increasingly hostile
Optimization of plant efficiency is the goal of today's
maintenance engineer. The application of reliable products
offering real savings, derived from increased mean time
between failures, which widens periods between planned
shutdowns, and the elimination of unplanned downtime
are becoming a reality when utilizing advanced
components accommodating split options.
environments.

Advantages of Split 	Roller Bearings

Split 	Roller Bearings are essential in applications involving limited access and are highly cost effective where
due to change-outs results in significant production losses.
are completely split to the shaft. Installation and inspection times are therefore
less 	. Additionally the time saved and costs eliminated by not having to remove
results i 	higher potential savings.
Inspection Simplified
No matter what the size or type of split 	roller
inspection is straight forward. Simply remove the
cap and the top half of the housing and all bearing
become visible and accessible.
As a result considerable numbers of man-hours can be
saved during planned maintenance, further adding to the
potential cost savings available.
Short Term Payback, Long Term Benefits.
Though it would be easy to cite examples where the use of
split bearings results in spectacular savings, the truth of the
matter is that savings of a significant amount can be made
in almost any application. Even modest savings can be
enough to justify the use of split bearings. Depending on
the application, down times for replacement of split
bearings can be a small fraction of those required for solid
bearings. This yields savings in both maintenance man-
hours and lost production.
When such cost savings are taken into account at
bearing selection stage, the case for Revolvo split
bearings becomes irrefutable.
Further Savings

Bearing Types
11
Retained Type Bearings (BR)
This bearing has integral flanges on the outer race to
provide a surface for axial load. This axial load is
accommodated on the inner race via the hardened
clamp rings, which both align the inner race halves and
provide roller guidance. In larger bearings the inner race
is manufactured with integral ribs for roller guidance
and axial load.
This type of bearing will locate the shaft axially as well as
provide a means for taking axial load. The retained outer
race must be fixed sideways against one of the housing
groove shoulders using the pins and screws provided. Only
one retained unit should be mounted on any particular
shaft. Additional care should be taken when mounting split
cylindrical roller bearing unit on shafts using other, non-split
types of bearings (ball, cylindrical and spherical roller, etc.)
to ensure there are no other locating bearings used.
Expansion Type Bearings (BX)
This bearing is designed for radial loads only. As in
the retained type bearing, the rollers are guided on
the inner race by the hardened shoulders of the
clamping rings.
During expansion or contraction of the shaft, rollers are
free to move across the outer race offering virtually
no resistance to axial movement. Limits for the amount
of axial movement are given in the Assembly and
Maintenance section.

Support Types

Support Units
bearings and housings may be mounted in a variety of support units according to the application and loading
constraints. A number of variants are available as standard types with other unit types available on request.
offer a design and manufacturing facility to produce custom units to cover more specialized applications.
Pillow Block (Support) Type
This is by far the most popular method for mounting Revolvo
units. These supports are manufactured from high strength,
ASTM 48A grade 40 cast iron. This, combined with the robust
design, provides a stable, rigid base, allowing the split bearing
fitted to give optimum performance.
Flange Units
In applications where bearings need to be mounted against
horizontal or vertical faces, Revolvo flange units provide a simple
means of achieving this goal. Again, the use of ASTM 48A Grade 40
cast iron ensures a durable unit.
Hanger Units
A compact unit commonly used for supporting screw
conveyors or similar equipment.
Take-up Units
These sliding units can be used to effectively
tension conveyor and elevator systems. Both
pull and push types are available.

Range Comparison
Bearing Series
13
Medium Series
An increased section offers additional load carrying
capacity. This series is typically used in arduous, heavily
loaded applications where shock load and vibration may
be present.
Comparison
Timken offers a range of bearing series, providing solutions for a wide range of operating conditions. Light Series,
Medium Series and Heavy Series offer an increasing ability to accommodate higher loads. As the series increases the speed
capability reduces.
Light Series
The most commonly applied series offering good load
and speed capabilities with the smallest section within
the range.
Heavy Series
A more specialized series used in the most
heavily loaded applications, generally
operating at relatively low speed.

Bearing Selection
14
Equivalent Load "P"
As previously stated radial and axial loads must be
considered separately for split cylindrical roller bearings.
calculation of theoretical life only radial loads
are considered.
Fr = Radial Loads
The value of Fr is that calculated from standard mechanical
formula, the impact of additional forces resulting from
external influences must also be considered.
Fz = Factor
Under the influence of the above conditions
P = Fr x Fz
The required theoretical bearing life is based upon a
number of factors, including reliability, accessibility and
service considerations. Generally life values should be as
follows:
Dynamic Loading
Selection of Revolvo split cylindrical roller bearings must take
into account the effects of both radial and axial loads. These
loads must be considered independently of each other.
Radial Load Considerations
The basic rating life of a bearing can be derived from the
formula laid down in ISO281:2007
L10 	= 	(C/P) 10
/3 (106 Revolutions) 	– (i)
In the majority of cases where the speed remains constant
then the life can be expressed in hours from the formula
L10h 	= 	(106
) x 	L10 	– (ii)
60 x n
Substituting – (i)
L10h 	= 	(106
) x 	C 	10
/3 	– (ii)
60 x n 	P
L10 	= Basic Rating Life (90% reliability), 106
Revolutions
L 10h 	= Basic Rating Life (90% Reliability), Hours
C 	= Bearing Dynamic Capacity, kN
n 	= Speed, min-1
P 	= Equivalent Bearing Load
This calculation assumes for the load components
considered for an individual bearing, that the shaft
system is a beam resting on rigid, moment free supports.
Elastic deformations in the bearing, housing or machine
structure are not taken into account.
Machine Used Intermittently 	500 to 2,000 hours
Occasional Use 	5,000 to 10,000 hours

High Reliability 	> 100,000 hours

Guide to Life Values

15
a3 Factor
The a3 factor considers all operational parameters that
influence fatigue life. The most obvious of these is
lubrication. The highest life values are achieved where a
state of hydrodynamic lubrication exists, in this state no
metal to metal contact occurs.
Decreasing effectiveness of lubricant due to decreasing
film thickness or effects of contamination will reduce the
a3 factor.
Due to the interrelationships between materials
adjustment factor a2 and operating adjustment factor a3,
a common factor a23 is frequently used.
a23 Factor
a23 = a2 + a3
The a23 factor can be taken from fig 1:
V 1 	= Rated Viscosity (Depends on bearing size and
operating speed)
V 	= Operating Viscosity (Depends on original
viscosity and operating temperature)
Adjusted Life Calculation
The L10 fatigue life calculation is based upon the
rating life of a large number of identical bearings
expressed as a number of revolutions operating
at a constant speed. This rating life is reached or
exceeded by 90% of these before the first evidence
of fatigue appears.
The above definition applies to bearings operating under
optimum conditions. Variations in operating conditions
will lead to changes in the life of these bearings.
ISO281 allows for an adjusted life calculation:
Lhna 	= 	a 1 x a2 x a3 x L10h
Where

Values for V and V1 are obtained from the following
graphs:
Where D = Bearing outside diameter
d = Bearing Bore
n – Shaft speed (RPM)
V1 is then read off the vertical axis.

Static Loading
In situations where bearings rotate slowly (<10 rpm),
oscillate slowly, are stationary for prolonged periods, or
subject to high shock loads, it is important to check that no
permanent deformations occur between rolling elements
and raceways at peak load.
The basic static load rating is defined in ISO 76:1987 and
refers to the contact stress at the centre of the most heavily
loaded rolling element/raceway contact area. For roller
bearings this value is 4000 Mpa. This will result in a
permanent deformation of 0.0001 of the roller diameter.
The required static load rating can be determined from:
Co = 	Fs. Po
Co = 	Basic Static Load Rating
Po = 	Equivalent Static Load
Fs 	= 	Static Safety Factor
Guidelines for the Static Safety Factor Fs can be found in
the table below:
Nature of Duty
Smooth no Vibration 	1.0 	1.5 	3.0
Normal 	1.0 	1.5 	3.5
Heavy 	>2.5 	>3.0 	>4.0
Requirements for Duty
Low 	Medium 	High
Using the operating temperature and nominal lubricant
viscosity, the value for operating viscosity, V, is read from
the horizontal axis.

Axial Considerations
18
Axial Ratings Ca
These ratings are for constant loads with oil or extra
pressure greases. If greases without extra pressure
additives are applied then the catalogue rating must
be decreased by 50%. In instances where bearings
operate at over 50% of their catalogue speed rating
and over 50% of their axial load ratings (Ca) then
recessed shafts should be considered. Please contact
Timken for assistance.
Axial Load
Bearing selection, on an axial load basis, must be
considered independently from the radial load.
1. 	Calculate the axial loads acting on the bearing
2. 	Multiply each load by the appropriate dynamic factor fz
3. 	Combine these loads to determine the effective axial
load Pa
4. 	Select a bearing having a Ca value greater than the
product of Pa x fdn, d.n is the product of the shaft size
in mm and the speed in r.p.m. To determine fdn use
the velocity graph below.

Bearing Clearance and Temperature
Considerations
19
bearings are manufactured to give an ISO ‘CN’ clearance as standard. At specific customer request, bearings may
be produced with any clearance to suit a particular application. When assessing the requirement for special clearances, it
is particularly important to consider the differential temperature between shaft and housing. It should also be noted that
an increase in bearing clearance will lead to a small reduction in bearing capacity. Typically a C3 clearance will reduce
capacity by 5% and C5 clearance by 10%.
Revolvo bearings can also be produced as C2. Thi
is smaller than CN and is typically used
involving shock or reciprocating loads.
Cleanliness of component parts when fitting will have a
direct impact on the running clearance of the bearing.
This is of particular importance when fitting 	new bearing
into existing cast iron or refitting bearings after
maintenance. Special care must be taken to remove
build-ups of aged grease and other contaminants in order
to avoid reducing the bearing clearance when fitted.
When selecting bearings for use at elevated temperatures,
consideration should also be given to the bearings
dimensional stability. Revolvo bearings are tempered to give
stability up to 284°F (140°C). In order to operate at
higher temperatures, bearings must be specially heat-
treated. This process will lead to a reduction in capacity as
a result of the reduced hardness.
The designations for specially heat-treated bearings are in
line with those quoted in ISO standards. The effects of
temperature stabilization are detailed in the table shown.
Operating Temperature 392°F 	482°F 	572°F
200°C 	250°C 	300°C
Designation 	S1 	S2 	S3
Reduction in Capacity 	10% 	25% 	40%

Support Loads
20
To determine a support 	suitability, one should
consider the resultant effective load derived in the
bearing selection process and the direction of that
load. The diagram shown indicates the area in which
the full Cor rating of the bearing may be applied.
Should the direction of the applied load be outside
area it may be necessary to consider alternative
or materials. 	has a proven track
innovative solutions and would be happy
provide assistance.
Throughout the 	range, the support units have
designed to provide a rigid and stable base to enable
associated bearing to operate to its full potential. With
in mind, all types of 	support units are
from 	cast i 	and
strengthening webs and ribs to provide a highly
unit. In order to compl ment the inherent strength,
recommend that careful consideration be given to the
siting and mounting of the support unit.

Bearing Frequencies
21
The individual components of any bearing will exhibit
frequency characteristics which will identify it within a
system subject to vibration analysis. For Revolvo bearings
these characteristic frequencies are detailed in the tables
opposite. The values given are for a nominal speed of 1
RPM. To obtain the correct frequency required for
vibration analysis software, multiply by the speed of
rotation in RPM.
For further information on Condition monitoring
services please contact Timken.
Condition monitoring is the collection, storage,
comparison and evaluation of data taken to establish the
running condition of a machine. The data can be made up
of several parameters, for example, electric current,
pressure, brush wear, vibration and temperature, to name
a few. Vibration Analysis is the area of condition
monitoring concerned with evaluating and identifying the
source of vibration within a system and assessing it's
severity and hence proposing the required maintenance
action.

Shaft Considerations
23
Recess Mounting
In applications where the resultant axial load exceeds 50% of the Ca rating for the bearing, the shaft design should
include either a recess for bearing seating or grooves to accommodate retaining rings. Such an arrangement should also
be considered if the unit is subjected to shock loads, fluctuations in temperature over 212°F or the shaft is vertical.
The dimensions for producing an appropriate recess or for governing the position and size of the retaining rings if used
are derived from the following table.
It is essential that the shaft on to which the bearing is to be mounted has been produced to the correct size and
tolerance for the operating conditions. If replacing a bearing in an existing system, the shaft must be checked to
establish if any wear or damage has taken place. The table below may be followed for both the manufacture of new
shafts and the inspection of existing shafts.

Sealing Arrangements
24
Any bearing, housing and support unit that is not suitably sealed against its surrounding environment is unlikely to
achieve its full potential, either in terms of performance or life span. The prevention of ingress of foreign materials and
contaminants is of paramount importance and should be considered as early in the selection process as possible.
A wide variety of sealing solutions are available to users of
Revolvo products as "off the shelf" arrangements. This range
will cover the vast majority of operating environments
throughout all industries. To cover those situations
a proprietary arrangement is not suitable, 	to
work closely with designers

Bearing Lubrication
27
The function of a lubricant in a rolling element bearing is to prevent metal to metal contact between components,
prevent wear and protect against corrosion. Two methods of lubrication are normal 	grease and oil. In the
case of Revolvo Split Bearings grease lubrication is most often employed.
Grease Lubrication
Greases can be used to lubricate 	split
under most normal conditions. Grease is the
method of lubrication because it can be more
retained within the bearing enclosure and housing,
latter simplifying sealing arrangements. Greases are
essentially oils thickened usually with a metal soap, other
ingredients are additives such as rust inhibitors, or extra
pressure additives. The oils employed may be mineral or
synthetic depending upon the application.
bearings are heat treated to retain dimensional
stability up to 284°F. At temperatures up to 212°F,
standard high quality greases may be used. We suggest
good quality lithium soap or complex based greases
having extra pressure additives and a penetration number
of 3. It is important to note that all values given in this
catalogue for axial capacity assume the use of a grease
with extra pressure (EP) additives. If EP additives are not
present then axial capacity is reduced by 50%
At temperatures exceeding 212°F care must be taken to
ensure that the correct thickener and viscosity of base oil
are selected. The performance of grease at such
temperatures is dependent on a stable thickener and the
temperature/viscosity ratio of the base oil. A stable base oil
and soap thickener are important as is the ability of the oil
to offer adequate viscosity at an elevated temperature.
In cases of water splash, calcium soap based greases may
be used, these are particularly resistant to water wash out.
Care should be taken when mixing greases with different
soap thickeners and base oil types. Please contact Timken
for further advice.
For initial lubrication the bearing should always be well
filled with grease. The remaining housing space should
be filled as follows.
At low speeds, not exceeding 25% of catalog speed
rating, we suggest that the remaining housing space be
fully filled with grease.
At medium speeds, between 25 and 50% of catalogue
speed rating, the remaining housing space may be 1/3
to 1/2 filled with grease.
At high speeds, exceeding 50% of catalogue speed
rating, the remaining housing space should be left
empty.
Re-lubrication
The re-lubrication intervals will be dependent on the
prevailing operating conditions.
Greases age and oxidize due to a number of
considerations these include load, speed, temperature,
cleanliness, presence of water and even airflow through
the bearing.
For retained type bearings, initial re-lubrication intervals
for guidance purposes would be 2 – 4 weeks with 0.1 -
0.2 ounces (3 - 6 mls) added. For expansion type
bearings, initial re-lubrication intervals would be 3 – 4
months with 0.1 - 0.2 ounces (3 – 6 mls) added. More
accurate intervals and quantities should be established
from observations taken during bearing operation. If re-
lubrication can be carried out whilst the bearing is in
operation, this will allow for even distribution of the
grease. This means of re-lubrication should only be
undertaken if it is safe to do so.

28
Oil Lubrication
Revolvo split cylindrical roller bearings are rarely lubricated with oil. In cases where oil is selected as a means of
lubrication, then special consideration must be given to the bearing housing design and sealing.
There are three principal methods of oil lubrication:
Oil Sump:
The oil sits in the bearing housing at a level approximately
halfway up the bottom dead cent 	rolling element. Oil
circulation around the bearing is then provided via the
bearing rotation agitating the oil sump. It is very important
to provide a sufficiently dimensioned oil sump as too small
a volume will result in increased frequency of oil change
and elevated operating temperatures.
Oil Mist:
An oil/air mist is injected into the bearing via nozzles,
normally a total oil loss system, this provides extremely
high speed capability at high cost.
For further advice on oil selection and oil lubrication
systems please consult Timken.
Oil Circulation:
Oil is circulated into the bearing housing assembly from
an external oil sump. This allows the oil to be cooled
and filtered, additionally an external oil sump normally
allows for a higher volume of oil. While being a more
optimum solution, specialist housing designs must be
provided. There is also a cost and space requirement to
this system.

Assembly and Maintenance
29
Shaft Check
When fitting bearings on both new and existing installations, the
shaft need only be raised 1⁄ 16 to 1⁄ 4 inch . This should provide sufficient
clearance to allow for easy fitting. Prior to the assembly of any
bearing components the shaft must be checked for size, roundness
and parallelism.
Check a minimum of three positions along the journal length.
Check a minimum of three positions around the shaft to
establish roundness.
Shaft tolerances and shaft surface finish are given in the table
on page 23.
Fitting the Inner Ring
Carefully unpack and clean the bearing removing all
preservatives.
Inner race locating clamping rings cannot be removed before
the cage has been dismantled.
Care must be taken that no damage occurs when cage halves
are separated.
Please Note:
Spring Clips should always be retained on one cage half.
Clean the shaft and lightly oil the bore of the inner race.
Place the two inner race halves in approximately the correct
position with the joints at the top and bottom. With the joints
in that position it will allow easy access to the clamp ring screws
later when they are tightened.
Ensure that the match marks (black band) in the clamp ring
groove on one side of the race coincide.
There should be an equal gap at each joint. If there are no gaps do
not proceed and contact Timken.
Fit the inner race locating clamping rings. Ensure that the
correct clamp ring is fitted in the corresponding groove. To
assist in this the clamping rings are intentionally manufactured
to different widths on the more popular sizes. In addition, the
match-marking groove found on the inner race is repeated on
the corresponding clamping ring.
Make sure that the thrust faces are not damaged when the
rings enter the grooves.
The joints should be at 90° to the inner race joints and the
screws should be tightened in such a way that there are four
equal gaps.
Screws should only be finger tight so that the race can be
adjusted axially into its final position.

Assembly of the Outer Race into the Seating
Groove in the Housing
The housing must be cleaned thoroughly removing all
preservatives. If reusing an existing housing it is essential that
the outer race seating groove is clean and free of any
hardened grease deposits or corrosion.
Lightly oil the seating groove and the outside diameter of the
outer race halves.
Place the race halves of the expansion or retained type into
the seating groove and ensure that:
The match marking numbers on the edge of each race
half coincide.
The lubrication hole in the outer race is in the upper housing
half.
The outer race joints should protrude equally above the
housing joint faces.
If a retained bearing is being fitted:
Pre-assemble the housing halves and fully tighten the joint
socket head cap screws.
Ensure that the joints are closed.
Fit the pins and screws provided and tighten up evenly to
ensure that the outer race is fixed square against the opposite
shoulder of the seating groove.
Larger bearings (both retained and expansion) may require outer
race retaining screws. If these are required, please ensure that the
flat washers are not omitted. Once fitted, ensure that the end of
the screw does not protrude above the race track surface.
Separate the housing halves, these are now ready for final
assembly.
Fit the appropriate seals. The seal grooves in the standard
housing are suitable for felt and synthetic rubber. If the
bearing is inspected or replaced on an existing installation
and the housing is re-used, we advise that new seals are fitted.
Pre-Fitting the Lower Housing Half
On existing installations it is often unnecessary to change the
support if a bearing, or bearing and housing has to be replaced.
In such cases the support base bolts should not be touched to
ensure that the replacement bearing and the old or new housing
will be in the same position as previously. In new installations the
support base should be positioned with the bolts finger tight. This
will allow additional freedom of movement when aligning the
inner and outer races.

Retained Bearing
Slide the pre-assembled bottom half into the support base.
Line up the inner and outer race roller track by adjusting the
inner ring sideways into the final position. The final position
should be confirmed by passing one half of the cage and roller
assembly between the inner and outer races. The cage half
should pass freely round the lower half of the bearing without
becoming jammed or trapped.
Remove the bottom housing half and tighten the clamp ring
socket head cap screws and fit the cage as explained below.
Expansion Bearing
As in the case of the retained bearing, slide in the
pre-assembled bottom housing half.
Line up the inner ring by adjusting it sideways until it is central
with the outer race.
The clearance between the inner race end faces and inside
housing walls should be equal. If cage and rollers are assembled
in this position the shaft can expand either side of the centre
line by the amount shown in column 1 in the table right.
When the position of the inner ring is satisfactory, remove the
bottom half housing and tighten the clamp ring socket head
cap screws and fit the cage as explained below.
A greater degree of expansion allowance can be obtained, but only
in one direction. This is achieved by offsetting the inner race with
respect to the housing. In this case the total amount of linear
movement in service is given in column 2 of the table.
Tightening of the Locating Clamping Ring
Screws
When the inner race is in its final position, tighten all four
clamping ring screws equally.
Use the correct hexagon key and a torque wrench.
Tap down the locating thrust rings with a nylon mallet to
ensure that they are seating down correctly within the grooves.
Re-tighten and repeat the tapping down until the screws are
fully tight.
Torque values for the various screw sizes are given in the tables
at the end of this section. If a screw is lost it must be replaced
using a High Tensile Socket Head Cap Screw Grade, 12.9.

Fitting the Cage
Grease the inner race roller track and cage.
Place the cage halves around the inner race ensuring that the
match mark numbers on the edge of each cage half are the
same and coincide at one joint.
Press the cage halves into the clip ensuring that the roll pins
are fully located.
Check that the cage assembly runs freely on the inner race.
Fully pack the cage and roller assembly with the correct type of
grease.
Final Fitting of the Housing
Charge the bottom and upper housing halves with the correct
amount of grease. Refer to page 27 for correct types and
quantities of grease depending on the application and the
speed.
Lightly oil the spherical diameter of both housing and support
and slide the bottom housing half into the support base.
Lower the shaft with the assembled inner races and cages, until
the rollers touch the tracks in the bottom half housing. Make
sure that when the rollers in the retained bearing enter the
outer race groove they do not damage the lips.
Rotate the shaft by hand, the rollers should move freely
between the thrust shoulders of the inner race and the lips of
the retained outer race.
Fit the upper housing half then tighten the housing joint
screws. Torque valves for housing screws are given in the table
at the end of this section. Check that there is no gap at the
joints.
Fitting the Support Cap
Place the support cap over the upper housing half and engage
the locating dowels at the joint.
Using a nylon mallet, gently tap the support cap down to
close the gap at the joints.
Fit the bolts and tighten just enough to hold the support joints
closed.
At this point, and only if it is safe to do so, the shaft should be
run at low speed and if possible, with low loading. This will
allow the spherical locating surfaces to correctly align. If
running the shaft under power is not an option, the shaft
should be rotated by hand to achieve this goal.
Tighten the cap bolts fully using a torque wrench. At this point
the support base bolts should also be checked and tightened as
required. Torque values for support screws are
given in the table at the end of this section.

Flange Units
When faced with flat horizontal or vertical faces, flange units offer a simple mounting solution. As with Pillow block
supports, Flange units are produced with spherical location to accommodate standard bearing housings and provide
easy initial alignment of shaft and equipment.
To facilitate positive location of the flange to the surface,
the rear face is recessed (dimensions N & V). This allows
for a spigot (Tolerance f8) to be located into the flange.
Bearing inspection is simply a matter of removing the top
half of the flange and housing. Bearing replacement may
also be achieved in the same manner if required.
When integrating flange units into new applications, it
should be noted that a maximum radial load equivalent
to 0.26Cor is permissible. A maximum axial load of 0.25Ca
must also be taken into account for applications with
thrust loading. Units for vertically oriented shafts may also
need special consideration given to sealing
arrangements.
As always, Timken will be happy to advise on any
application issues.

Tensioning Units
This type of split unit can be found in use on materials handling equipment in many industries. Take up units provide an
efficient and readily accessible means of tensioning conveyor systems and large scale drives.
The units consist of either push type or pull type sliding supports into which standard housings and bearings may be
mounted. When integrating tensioning units into new applications, it should be noted that a maximum radial load
equivalent to 0.3Cor is permissible. As with all Revolvo Units, a wide variety of sealing solutions may be applied dependant
on the environment and application. Please contact Timken for assistance.

Due to the arduous conditions often found in screw conveyor applications, correct seal selection is critical.
units are available with many sealing variants, all of which can also be tailored to suit specific applications. When
integrating hanging units into new applications, it should be noted that a maximum radial load equivalent to 0.3Cor is
permissible. Please contact Timken for further information.
Hanger Units are the optimum solution for the support of screw conveyor shafts. The unit comprises of a cast iron
split housing into which standard split cylindrical roller bearings are fitted. Provision of a drilled and tapped boss in one
half of the housing allows for the unit to be mounted from the conveyor cross bracing or any other suitable surface. It is
recommended that some form of swivel fixing be incorporated into the mounting arrangement to allow for static
alignment.

Medium Series Product
Medium Series bearing products can be utilized in applications requiring higher load carrying
capacity. Under nominal conditions, Medium Series may also be selected to provide an extended
bearing life when compared to Light Series. Medium Series offers the same range of mounting
and sealing solutions as Light Series, with the exception of Hanger units. If a standard catalog
product does not meet your requirements, Timken will be happy to provide help and advice on
your application.

Flange Units
When faced with flat horizontal or vertical faces, flange units offer a simple mounting solution. As with Pillow block
supports, Flange units are produced with spherical location to accommodate standard bearing housings and provide
easy initial alignment of shaft and equipment.
To facilitate positive location of the flange to the surface,
the rear face is recessed (dimensions N & V). This allows
for a spigot (Tolerance f8) to be located into the flange.
Bearing inspection is simply a matter of removing the top
half of the flange and housing. Bearing replacement may
also be achieved in the same manner if required.
When integrating flange units into new applications, it
should be noted that a maximum radial load equivalent
to 0.26Cor is permissible. A maximum axial load of 0.25Ca
must also be taken into account for applications with
thrust loading. Units for vertically oriented shafts may also
need special consideration given to sealing
arrangements.
As always, 	will be happy to advise on any
application issues.

Tensioning Units
This type of split unit can be found in use on materials handling equipment in many industries. Take up units provide an
efficient and readily accessible means of tensioning conveyor systems and large scale drives.
The units consist of either push type or pull type sliding supports into which standard housings and bearings may be
mounted. When integrating tensioning units into new applications, it should be noted that a maximum radial load
equivalent to 0.3Cor is permissible. As with all 	Units, a wide variety of sealing solutions may be applied dependant
on the environment and application. Please contact Timken for assistance.

Flange Units
When faced with flat horizontal or vertical faces, flange units offer a simple mounting solution. As with Pillow block
supports, Flange units are produced with spherical location to accommodate standard bearing housings and provide
easy initial alignment of shaft and equipment.
To facilitate positive location of the flange to the surface,
the rear face is recessed (dimensions N & V). This allows
for a spigot (Tolerance f8) to be located into the flange.
Bearing inspection is simply a matter of removing the top
half of the flange and housing. Bearing replacement may
also be achieved in the same manner if required.
When integrating flange units into new applications, it
should be noted that a maximum radial load equivalent
to 0.26Cor is permissible. A maximum axial load of 0.25Ca
must also be taken into account for applications with
thrust loading. Units for vertically oriented shafts may also
need special consideration given to sealing
arrangements.
As always, Timken will be happy to advise on any
application issues.

and Seal References
The most popular sealing solution for split cylindrical roller bearings after the standard felt seal is the Triple Labyrinth.
This none contacting seal offers resistance to contaminant ingress at speeds greater than can be
accommodated by other seal types (see page 25).
